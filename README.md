# Portfolio-first-attempt

**Overview:**
>For this project, I used the template given to us in our homework folder to build a portfolio webpage. My goal was to create the webpage with the same structure and functionality as the template, while changing some of the styling to make it more personalized for my preferences. I used information and pictures of my dog, Poppy, to chronicle her budding career as a web developer :)

**Technologies:**
>This webpage was created using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, no JavaScript other than that needed for the Bootstrap was used.

**Challenges:**
>I found it difficult to match the grids exactly like the template provided. This activity pushed me to figure out Bootstrap grids.

**Future Development:**
>In the future, it would be exciting to add JavaScript to this webpage to make it a more dynamic experience for the user.
